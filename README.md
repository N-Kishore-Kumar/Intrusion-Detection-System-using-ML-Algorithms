We have tried to detect the intruders by implement the network intrusion detection system using neural network with the help of technologies: Python. This will be done using 9 different algorithms as below:
Algorithms used are Logical Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine - linear,Poly,Rbf,Sigmoid, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors
Along with machine learning, we will be using parallel computing to decrease the computational time and improve the performance of the model.
